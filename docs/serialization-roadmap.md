# Serialization Roadmap

Current status:

- Native `dump_to_file` / `load_from_file` works for x86/x86_64/AArch64 with dedicated roundtrip coverage.
- Minidump `dump_to_minidump` / `load_from_minidump` works for x86/x86_64/AArch64.
- All previously-ignored AArch64 serialization and minidump tests are enabled and passing.

## Phase 1: Native Serialization Architecture Parity

- [x] Replace x86-only `SerializableThreadContext` payloads with architecture-aware variants.
- [x] Add AArch64 thread serialization for `RegsAarch64`, pre-op regs, and post-op regs.
- [x] Refactor `SerializableEmu` flattened current-thread state so it is not hard-wired to x86 registers/flags/FPU.
- [x] Refactor instruction/decode serialization so `ArchState::X86` and `ArchState::AArch64` can both be represented and restored.
- [x] Make `SerializableEmu::from(&Emu)` stop using x86-only accessors on AArch64.
- [x] Make `From<SerializableEmu> for Emu` restore AArch64 thread state and `arch_state` structurally.
- [x] Investigate and fix the current stack overflow in `test_aarch64_native_serialization_fixture_roundtrip`.
- [x] Replace the placeholder serialization smoke test with real native roundtrip coverage.
- [x] Unignore `test_aarch64_native_serialization_fixture_roundtrip`.

## Phase 2: AArch64 Minidump Import

- [x] Parse `MinidumpRawContext::Arm64` and `MinidumpRawContext::OldArm64`.
- [x] Map ARM64 minidump register state into `RegsAarch64` (`x0..x30`, `sp`, `pc`, `nzcv`, FP/SIMD state).
- [x] Build an AArch64 `SerializableEmu` from imported minidumps instead of routing through x86-shaped fields.
- [x] Preserve AArch64 `cfg.arch`, OS, memory maps, modules, and current thread state on import.
- [x] Treat ARM64 PE modules as 64-bit when reconstructing imported module metadata.
- [x] Add an ARM64 minidump import fixture test.
- [x] Unignore `test_aarch64_minidump_fixture_roundtrip` once import/export are ready.

## Phase 3: AArch64 Minidump Export

- [x] Emit a valid `CONTEXT_ARM64` blob from `RegsAarch64`.
- [x] Teach the minidump writer to export `ArchThreadState::AArch64`.
- [x] Export ARM64 thread context, stack location, and relevant SIMD/FP register state.
- [x] Validate ARM64 minidumps with the Rust `minidump` parser.
- [ ] Validate generated dumps with at least one external consumer such as Ghidra or WinDbg.

## Done Means

- [x] Native serialization round-trips x86, x86_64, and AArch64 fixtures.
- [x] Minidump import/export round-trips x86, x86_64, and AArch64 fixtures.
- [x] The ignored AArch64 serialization/minidump tests are enabled and passing.
- [x] The old x86-only "too complex" placeholder test is removed or replaced with real assertions.

## Remaining

- [ ] Validate generated ARM64 dumps with at least one external consumer (Ghidra or WinDbg).
- [x] Refactor `Emu::new()` to accept an `Arch` parameter to avoid the two-step init_cpu pattern.
