This x86 specific test-set are created by Kenan Sulayman https://github.com/19h/ 
and is part of his RAX project:

`https://github.com/19h/rax/tree/master/tests/x86_64`

The tests have been adapted to use libmwemu's api.

I'm working on adapting the tests, for now just shld and the regex to do the conversion.
